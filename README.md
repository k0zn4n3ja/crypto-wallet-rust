# üóùÔ∏è Wolet

Wolet is a BIP32, BIP39 and BIP44 compliant HD wallet. Currently wallet state is saved to file as JSON and encrypted with a password, later if I feel like it I will move to a more resilient system.

I will do a front end for it when I feel like it.

## HD Wallet Tree Structure

As this is a simple side project the eventual UI will only support the one-address-per-account structure. Example tree:

However the underlying rust library supports any HD wallet tree structure compliant to BIP44.
